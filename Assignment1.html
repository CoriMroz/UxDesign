<h2 class="w3-center">Colonization of Mars</h2><br>
<h5 class="w3-center"> <a href="https://mars-colony.life/">mars-colony.life</a></h5>
<p class="w3-large">
The purpose of this site is to inform people about Mars and about our efforts to colonize the planet. It is an educational website created by Uprock Interface Design school to show, not only information, but also beautiful UI and UX design.</p>
<p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">
The website is very clean and seamless with how it goes about this, opting for a smooth scroll instead of having different web pages and links. This adds to the user experience and keeps the attention of the user by taking out the need to wait for pages to load. </br></br>
The information is all kept very brief and informative. Users aren’t forced to read huge paragraphs and don’t need to spend a lot of time to understand the main points of the site. This adds to the clean design and helps keep readers from becoming bored or letting their attention wander. </br></br>
However, the scroll design can also be a negative. When there’s no easy link to some sections of information, it becomes difficult to easily jump to where you need to be on the website. This can lead to an excess of time being spent scrolling and can be very frustrating. </br></br>

<h5 class="w3-center"> <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/">airbnb.co.uk</a></h5>
<p class="w3-large">
AirBnB is a well known site that has two purposes: It allows users to ‘host’ their house for rent to people looking for a place to stay, whether for work, vacation, or other uses. It also acts as a market for those looking for a place to stay, allowing them to look through places that others have posted for rental.</p>
<p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">
 This website is very appealing visually, with a simple user interface and attractive images that reinforce the main goal of the site. Getting started looking for somewhere is very simple with the top search bar, where you only need a location to begin searching for a place to stay. With a clean UI, users will easily know how to do exactly what they want and where to find their best options.</br></br> 
 The site also seems intuitive for those looking to host their home as an option. You only need a few basics to ‘start your listing’ which keeps the site clean and doesn’t overcrowd the screen with too much text or too many options. </br></br>

<h2 class="w3-center">Yale School of Art</h2><br>
<h5 class="w3-center"> <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">www.art.yale.edu</a></h5>
<p class="w3-large">
This site is created and maintained very frequently by Yale’s School of art, which makes it almost worse how visually unappealing it is. The purpose of this site is to display art created by the students of Yale’s art school and keep visitors to the site updated with information about events or important news in reference to the school. </p>
<p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">
The background is updated to be a piece of art created by one of the students, usually a gif which is made to fill the entire screen in a tile format if the original size of the file isn’t the perfect size of the screen. With the animations turned on (and even without them) the site becomes extremely busy and the user doesn’t know where to look even after being on the site for a length of time. </br></br>
The text of the site is also very chaotic as well. Different sizes of text appear on different colored backgrounds, some text bold, some underlined. I noticed, a bright orange background, a baby blue one, and a yellow and white gradient among others. Scrolling also feels hectic as the background never moves, but the text does. </br></br>
Even simple changes, such as putting some effort into positioning elements, will create a cleaner and nicer looking website. Having all the text elements be of relatively similar size would also create a more cohesive site and keeping one concise color scheme would keep the different elements from clashing with each other so much.</p>
